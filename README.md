## Ordered Sum 
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers **between** including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b. <br>

Note: a and b are not ordered! <br>

```javascript
GetSum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1
GetSum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3
GetSum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
GetSum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
GetSum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1
GetSum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
```

## Count characters in your string

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters(UTF-8) in string. If you have string like this aba then the result should be { 'a': 2, 'b': 1 } <br>

What if the string is empty ? Then the result should be empty object literal { } <br>
